#Summary

Elemental Dancers is a boss rush game where the player fights a series of elemental bosses. Each boss has unique attack patterns and phases.

#Bosses

-Sand Boss: A snake that bites the player when nearby. In the second phase, it burrows underground and attacks from below.

-Volcano Boss: A golem that attacks on contact. In the second phase, it throws rocks at the player.

-Iceberg Boss (WIP): A killer whale that throws icicles (currently incomplete and non-functional).

#Player Forms

The player can change elemental forms, which affect visuals and abilities:

-Ice Form: Visual ice effects.

-Fire Form: Visual fire effects.

-Planned: Sand Form (not implemented).

#The original concept involved a slot-machine-like mechanic to randomly select the player form and boss per round, inspired by the game jam theme "Spin," but it was not implemented due to development constraints.#

#Gameplay

-Movement: A / D keys (Joystick compatible)

-Attack: Right mouse click (hold for charged attack)

-Jump: Space

-Special Ability: E

-Pause: Esc

#Additional notes:

-Iceberg Boss currently lacks a custom soundtrack.

-Sountrack might not work properly in the build
